#### Linear Data Structures
### Stack
A stack is a linear data structure where all insertions and deletions are restricted to one end, called the top. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element inserted is the first to be removed.

## Principal Operations on a Stack
push(element): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop(): Removes the element from the top of the stack.
isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
isFull(): Checks if the stack is full.
top(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
## Stack Implementation
# Using an Array
Push operation: Check if the stack is full, then add the element to the next available position.
Pop operation: Check if the stack is empty, then remove the element from the top position.
# Using a Linked List
Push operation: Create a new node and make it the top of the stack.
Pop operation: Remove the node at the top and update the top to the next node.
### Queue
A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where the first element inserted is the first element removed. Insertions are made at the rear end, and deletions are made from the front end.

## Principal Operations on a Queue
enqueue(element): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
dequeue(): Removes an element from the front of the queue.
isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
isFull(): Checks if the queue is full.
front(): Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
back(): Returns the element at the rear of the queue without removing it.
## Queue Implementation
# Using an Array
Enqueue operation: Check if the queue is full, then add the element at the rear position and update the rear.
Dequeue operation: Check if the queue is empty, then remove the element from the front position and update the front.
# Using a Linked List
Enqueue operation: Create a new node and add it at the rear end.
Dequeue operation: Remove the node from the front and update the front to the next node.
